# New Portfolio
this is an updated version of my portfolio


This is an updated version of my portfolio that I will use to show off my coding projects to potential employers.

I attempted to create a basic layout that would effectivly inform those who visit my site about my contact information, LinkedIn, and GitHub profile.

I wrote a small "About Me" section to give people an impression of the kind of person and worker I am.

I did some extra work as well to make the site look more appealing, specifically the gifs I created on the project page. I thought
this would show employers that I have a sense of style and some extra skills to spice things up.

There weren't too many challanges with the assignment. The only real trouble I had was re-learning some of the basic properties about
Bootstrap and how to divide everything into rows and coloumns.
